## Overview
This code includes two implementations of a Neural Network, based on pre-trained weights and biases obtained from https://github.com/talo/hackathon-go-brrr: 
- CPU only
- CPU & GPU

## How to Run
Run `make` first, which will assemble the project and create binaries in /bin directory.
The shell scripts for each implementations runs the produced executable. 

## Dependencies 
- CUDA version 12.5
- NVCC compiler with support of architecture 61
- G++ compiler with support of C++ 17

## Optimisations
- Matrices are stored/parsed as 1D arrays
- Use of multi-threading on CPU and GPU
- Processing multiple inputs as a matrix
- Logic optimisations for parsing input functions
- Fast approximation for exponential function
